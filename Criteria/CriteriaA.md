  ### Definition of Problem 
  
  Client XXX Sensei is a high school teacher at an International School in Japan. Seeing as she has to spend much time to create quizzes and marking for her students. Also, she sometimes makes mistake on marking the students' work leading to give them wrong grade and when it comes to the important test, it might be really a big problem. Moreover, as each students have different level of vocabulary on the class, so it takes her lots of time to create quizzes for individual students. Lastly, for some online classes, she only can give her students homework as online exercises so it is hard for her to see and check students handwriting as the students only type or choose the correct answers for the exercises. Theses convenience makes her feel uncomfortable and wastes her time.
  
  In September, 2020 during the Japanese class time, she had talked to me about her problems with Japanese quizzes. She described what she wanted: to have a program that can automatically generate Japanese vocabulary quiz by topic. Also it can create vocab list and flashcard based on the student's answers on the quizzes and automatically marks the students answers. 
  
  As she was talking about her problems, I thought it was a good materials for my Computer Science Internal Assessment because XXX sensei wanted to have IT solution for her problems. 

  ### Proposed solution
  
  After consulting with her, I decided to help her develop a Japanese Review Question System to help her keep track of her questions paper and the marking. Moreover, one version will be created for students to export and submit their work back to sensei. I decided to use the Python language and Qtdesigner to develop the system. The Python language is the second-ranking popular and widely-used programming language. Also, the Python language is concise, expressive, and close to human thinking. The QtDesigner is a useful tool for creating GUI that can read input and represent the output inside the interface.Furthermore, the UI file can be converted to Python code to modify the elements, design, and create functions for the UI's buttons and ouput elements. The project centers around **technical feasibility**, using only Python and QtDesigner, making that aspect simple and not concerning. The Python language can run well on many operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Furthermore, the program requires a medium to low-performance computer to execute. The program can run offline and only need the Internet when sending the question to her students. These also make the system's **economic feasibility** feasible because the user only needs to spend money on purchasing the program, cheap hardware such as keyboard, mouse, and training how to use the program. She also has the computer to operate it, so it is not a big duel. The **operational feasibility** is also done because the program is relatively simple to use; after a short training, the user can confidently use it without facing any difficulties. The project **schedule** depends on the user; however, building the program will take 2 months. 

 
   ### Success Criteria
  
  1. There are two versions of the program: one for teach and one for student
  
  2. The questions and answers can be added, edited, deleted in the teacher program'
  
  3. The questions and answers can be stored in the database
  
  4. A finding function helping user to easily find the food information in the teacher program
  
  5. There is a list that shows all the recent questions
  
  6. The app version for students can read the export questions without the answer.
  
  7. The app version for students can automatically mark the student's work
  
  8. The results of the students can be stored in database and exported
  
  9. There is a backup function in both teachers and students app
  
  10. Students' marks can be sorted by rank for each test
  
  11. All of the database files will be sent to the github
  
  12. Both the apps can push and receive the file from the github
