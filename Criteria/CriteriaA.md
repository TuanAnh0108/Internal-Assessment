  ### Definition of Problem
  
   I am developing a Japanese Review Questions System for Arico Sensei. She is a client, seeing as she has to spend a lot of paper to print out the questions for her students. Also, she can only give the review questions when she meets her students in the class time so that if she forgets to bring the questions, the students cannot practice when they come back home after class. Moreover, she has to spend a lot of time marking the paper for each student, and sometimes she makes some mistakes and gives the wrong grade. Due to the amount of paper, sometimes, the past papers could be lost, or she has to spend much time finding where they are and usually has to empty her storage with unused paper. This inconvenience makes her feel uncomfortable and wasted her time. Through this, I help her to develop a Japanese Review Question System to help her keep track of not only her questions paper but also the marking.
  
  ### Proposed solution
  
   The food management system is feasible to make. I decided to use Python language to develop the system. The Python language is 2nd ranking popular and widely-used programming language. Also, the Python language is really concise, expressive and close to human thinking. The project centers around **technical feasibility**, using only Python, making that aspect simple and not concerning. The Python language can run well on many types of operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, Linux. Furthermore, the program just requires medium to low - performance computer to execute. This also makes the **economic feasibility** of the system is feasible due to the user just only need to spend money on purchasing the program, cheap hardware such as keyboard, mouse and training how to use the program. He also has the computer to operate it so it is not a big duel. The **operational feasibility** is also done due to the program is relatively simple to use, after short training the user can confidently use it without facing any difficulties. The **schedule** of the project denpends on the experience of the user, however, for building the program, it only takes 1 week to build it and training the user. Moreover, it will take less than haf a week for user to input all the food he has. In overall, this programm is realistic and easily developed.
 
   ### Success Criteria
  
  ① The program has the log in, security system that only the user can access
  
  ② The new food can be added
  
  ③ The food properties, information such as name, experation date, money spend on that food can be edited
  
  ④ The food information can be stored in the database
  
  ⑤ The food can be deleted 
  
  ⑥ A finding function helping user to easily find the food information
  
  ⑦ A summary dialog to summerize the quantity, price of the food
  
  ⑧ The information of the food is shown in a table
  
  ⑨ There is also log out button to help user close the app
