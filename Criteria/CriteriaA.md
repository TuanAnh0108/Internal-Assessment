  ### Definition of Problem
  
  I am developing a Japanese Review Questions System for my Sensei. She is a client, seeing as she has to spend much paper to print out her students' questions. Also, she can only give the review questions when she meets her students in the class time so that if she forgets to bring the questions, the students cannot practice when they come back home after class. Moreover, she has to spend much time marking the paper for each student, and sometimes she makes some mistakes and gives the wrong grade. Due to the amount of paper, sometimes, the past papers could be lost, or she has to spend much time finding where they are and usually has to empty her storage with unused paper. This inconvenience makes her feel uncomfortable and wasted her time.
  
  ### Proposed solution
  
  After consulting with her, I decided to help her develop a Japanese Review Question System to help her keep track of her questions paper and the marking. Moreover, one version will be created for students to export and submit their work back to sensei. I decided to use the Python language and Qtdesigner to develop the system. The Python language is the second-ranking popular and widely-used programming language. Also, the Python language is concise, expressive, and close to human thinking. The QtDesigner is a useful tool for creating GUI that can read input and represent the output inside the interface.Furthermore, the UI file can be converted to Python code to modify the elements, design, and create functions for the UI's buttons and ouput elements. The project centers around technical feasibility, using only Python and QtDesigner, making that aspect simple and not concerning. The Python language can run well on many operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Furthermore, the program requires a medium to low-performance computer to execute. The program can run offline and only need the Internet when sending the question to her students. These also make the system's economic feasibility feasible because the user only needs to spend money on purchasing the program, cheap hardware such as keyboard, mouse, and training how to use the program. She also has the computer to operate it, so it is not a big duel. The operational feasibility is also done because the program is relatively simple to use; after a short training, the user can confidently use it without facing any difficulties. The project schedule depends on the user; however, building the program will take 2 months.

 
   ### Success Criteria
  
  1. There are two versions of the program: one for teach and one for student
  
  2. The questions and answers can be added, edited, deleted in the teacher program'
  
  3. The questions and answers can be stored in the database
  
  4. A finding function helping user to easily find the food information in the teacher program
  
  5. There is a list that shows all the recent questions
  
  6. The app version for students can read the export questions without the answer.
  
  7. The app version for students can automatically mark the student's work
  
  8. The results of the students can be stored in database and exported
  
  9. There is a backup function in both teachers and students app
  
  10. Students' marks can be sorted by rank for each test
  
  11. All of the database files will be sent to the github
  
  12. Both the apps can push and receive the file from the github
