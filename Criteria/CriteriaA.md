  ### Definition of Problem
  
   I am developing a Japanese Review Questions System for my Sensei. She is a client, seeing as she has to spend a lot of paper to print out the questions for her students. Also, she can only give the review questions when she meets her students in the class time so that if she forgets to bring the questions, the students cannot practice when they come back home after class. Moreover, she has to spend a lot of time marking the paper for each student, and sometimes she makes some mistakes and gives the wrong grade. Due to the amount of paper, sometimes, the past papers could be lost, or she has to spend much time finding where they are and usually has to empty her storage with unused paper. This inconvenience makes her feel uncomfortable and wasted her time. 
  
  ### Proposed solution
  
   After consulting with her, I decided to help her to develop a Japanese Review Question System to help her keep track of not only her questions paper but also the marking. And, one version will be created for students so that they can export and submit their work back to sensei. 
   I decided to use Python language and Qtdesigner to develop the system. The Python language is 2nd ranking popular and widely-used programming language. Also, the Python language is really concise, expressive and close to human thinking. The QtDesigner is a good tool for creating GUI that can read input and represent the output inside the interface. Furthermore, the ui file can be converted to Python code so that I can modify the elements, design and create functions for the buttons and ouput element on the UI. The project centers around **technical feasibility**, using only Python ans QtDesigner, making that aspect simple and not concerning. The Python language can run well on many types of operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, Linux. Furthermore, the program just requires medium to low - performance computer to execute. The program can run offline and only need the Internet when sending the question to her students. These also make the **economic feasibility** of the system is feasible due to the user just only need to spend money on purchasing the program, cheap hardware such as keyboard, mouse and training how to use the program. She also has the computer to operate it so it is not a big duel. The **operational feasibility** is also done due to the program is relatively simple to use, after short training the user can confidently use it without facing any difficulties. The **schedule** of the project denpends on the experience of the user, however, for building the program, it takes 2 months to build it.
 
   ### Success Criteria
  
  1. There are two versions of the program: one for teach and one for student
  
  2. The questions and answers can be added, edited, deleted in the teacher program'
  
  3. The questions and answers can be stored in the database
  
  4. A finding function helping user to easily find the food information in the teacher program
  
  5. There is a list that shows all the recent questions
  
  6. The app version for students can read the export questions without the answer.
  
  7. The app version for students can automatically mark the student's work
  
  8. The results of the students can be stored in database and exported
  
  9. There is a backup function in both teachers and students app
  
  10. Students' marks can be sorted by rank for each test
  
  11. All of the database files will be sent to the github
  
  12. Both the apps can push and receive the file from the github
