  ### Definition of Problem 
  
 Client XXX Sensei is a high school teacher at an International School in Japan. Seeing as she has to spend much time to create quizzes and marking for her 
 students. Also, she sometimes makes mistakes in marking the students' work, leading to the wrong grade, and when it comes to the important test, it might be a 
 big problem. Moreover, as each student has different vocabulary levels in the class, it takes her lots of time to create quizzes for individual students. Lastly, 
 for some online classes it is hard for her to see and check students' handwriting as the students only type or choose the correct answers for the online exercises.
 These conveniences make her feel uncomfortable and wastes her time. During the Japanese class time, she had talked to me about her problems with Japanese 
 quizzes. She described what she wanted: to have a program that can automatically generate a Japanese vocabulary quiz by topic. It can also create a vocab list and 
 flashcard based on the student's answers on the quizzes and automatically marks the students' answers. 
  
  ### Proposed solution
    
I will make separate apps, one for sensei and one for students. Sensei will be able to look at the answers and the record of the performance of the students 
through the quiz they take and give them comment. For student's app, there will be functions that are taking the quiz, Vocabulary List, Flashcard and Kanji study, and History of the previous quizzes. Both two apps will connect to GitHub server so that the files from both two apps can be transferred to each other. I decided to use the Python language and Qtdesigner to develop the system. The Python language is the second-ranking popular and widely-used programming language.  The QtDesigner is a useful tool for creating GUI that can read input and represent the output inside the interface. Also, it can create a button and assign them 
with different methods through Python. The Python language can run well on many operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The program can run offline
and only need the Internet when uploading students' records to the GitHub server.

   ### Success Criteria

1.	There are two versions of the program: one for teach and one for students.

2.	The vocab quiz and kanji vocabulary can be generated automatically

3.	The program checks the answers automatically 

4.	The record of students’ answer will be submitted to the teachers’ app

5.	The wrong vocabulary answer in the quiz will be added to the vocabulary list and flashcard.

6.	The vocabulary in the quiz is sorted by topic.  

7.	The record for each students’ quiz can be saved into the database and displayed into the history window.

8.	The student’s answers are hand-written and it will convert to the text.  

9.  The programs have the log in system for privacy
